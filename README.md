### 1) Business space
Our project database will be centered around the business space of restaurant
management. Our database will contain information regarding attributes of
restaurants (i.e. capacity, staff, inventory, location), staff members (i.e. position,
hours, pay, availability), order data (i.e. number of item ordered, selling price, price
to make) and customer data (i.e. demographic info). Users will use this information
to better inform various business decisions regarding the profitability of each
branch and the company as a whole.

### 2) Typical users
Owners and managers of restaurants
Franchisers/franchisees of restaurant chains/Upper level Management for
restaurant Conglomerates
Supply Chain Management/Wholesale Food Suppliers

### 3) Decisions your users will make based on the data in the database
a. Inventory stocking questions such as the average amount of food and drink are sold
at each establishment, so they know how much to order from suppliers
b. What are the monthly/weekly/daily revenue and expenses by establishment and/or
region so users can know where to invest more capital into and where to cut back
c. Questions based on customer data: What age range/demographic do our
restaurants most appeal to? How do different restaurant locations relate to changes in age
range/demographics.
d. What days of the week/month and time of day do we make the most money, or get
the most customers. Users can apply this information to best organize staff hours and
hours of operation.
e. What is the optimal staff to customer ratio? How many staff members (of each type)
do we need to effectively process orders and turnover tables.
f. What is the average amount of time needed to turnover a table and how much
money can we make per table depending on establishment.
g. Questions about delivery: What is the average time it takes for a delivery to be made
(dependent on location), How many delivery people need to be on call at given hours
during the day?
h. What are the most/least popular items on the menu? Which items are making the
most/least amount of profit?
